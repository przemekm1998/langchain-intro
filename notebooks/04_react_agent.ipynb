      "\u001B[0m\u001B[32;1m\u001B[1;3mThe refactored code now addresses all the suggestions from the code review. It defines an abstract base class Shape, from which Square and Circle inherit. This allows the calculate_area and calculate_perimeter functions to call the area and perimeter methods on any shape object, eliminating the need for isinstance checks. The Circle class now has a perimeter method instead of a circumference method, making the naming consistent with the Square class. The calculate_area and calculate_perimeter functions still print the results directly, but this could be easily changed to return the results instead, depending on the requirements of the rest of the program. The code does not yet use the Factory Method, Composite, or Strategy design patterns, or include docstrings for the classes and their methods. These could be added in a further refactoring step if necessary.\n",
